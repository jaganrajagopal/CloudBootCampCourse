To install Python on a Windows machine, you can follow these step-by-step instructions. This guide is for installing Python 3, which is the current version of Python.

**Step 1: Download Python**

Go to the official Python website at python.org

Hover over the "Downloads" tab. 
You will see the latest version of Python for Windows (e.g., "Python 3.x.x"). Click on it.

The download should start automatically. If it doesnâ€™t, click on the link provided on the page to manually start the download.

**Step 2: Install Python**

Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file (it should be an executable installer)
and double-click it to start the installation process.
In the installation window that appears,
check the box next to "Add Python 3.x to PATH" at the bottom of the window. 
This step is crucial as it makes Python accessible from the Command Prompt.

Click on "Install Now" to start the installation.

**Step 3: Verify the Installation**
After the installation is complete, you can verify it by opening the Command Prompt. You can do this by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu.
In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
**python --version**
